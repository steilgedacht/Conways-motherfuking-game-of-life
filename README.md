# Conways-motherfuking-game-of-life

A simple simulation of Conways Game of Life made in Visual Studio.
The project files are in [/Conways motherfuking game of life](https://github.com/steilgedacht/Conways-motherfuking-game-of-life/tree/main/Conways%20motherfuking%20game%20of%20life). 
The executable program is [Conways motherfuking game of life.exe](https://github.com/steilgedacht/Conways-motherfuking-game-of-life/blob/main/Conways%20motherfuking%20game%20of%20life.exe)

Each pixel represents a cell and therefore it is recomended to use a screen magnifier to inspect the individual cells.

There are 4 controls:
First there is the Generate Button which generates a random pattern.
Then you can Start or Stop the Simulation with the Start and Stop Key.
You can also adjust the speed of the simulation and with the number you control the size of the field.
The default size of the field is 499 which may be very calculation intensiv for your computer.
